# ReadMeGen

## Description
This is a generator to make the process of readme making quite easier!
- My motivation to make this was so I could ease the flow of making readme's since as a web developer, it is done a lot!
- I built this project to help further my understanding of Node and how to properly install dependencies and debug it.
- This project will make readme creation easier by giving you the prompts so you can answer them with ease!
- I learnt a lot more about Node throughout this project.

I may want to add an A.I integration in the future! to have the option to optimize your Readme generated with an A.I , any ideas are welcome though.
